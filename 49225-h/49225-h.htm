<p class="tb">In the picturesque canyon and mesa country of the Pajarito Plateau,
west of the Rio Grande from Santa Fe, N. Mex., are found
the ruined dwellings of one of the most extensive prehistoric Indian
populations of the Southwest. Bandelier National Monument, in
the heart of the plateau, includes and protects several of the largest
of these ruins, in particular the unique cave and cliff dwellings in the
canyon of the Rito de los Frijoles.</p>
<p>The Indian farmers who built and occupied the numerous villages
of the Pajarito Plateau flourished there for some 300 years, beginning in
the 1200&rsquo;s. By A. D. 1540, when historic times open with the coming
of Coronado and his adventurers from Mexico, the Indian people had
already started to leave their canyon fastnesses for new homes on the
Rio Grande.</p>
<p>From all evidence it seems that modern Pueblo Indians living along
the Rio Grande today are descended in part from the ancient inhabitants
of the Pajarito area. Thus Bandelier National Monument preserves
ruins which link historic times to prehistoric, and which further
link the modern Pueblo Indian with his ancestors from regions to the
west, whence came the first migrants to the Bandelier environs. The
continuity of Pueblo life traces from origins in northwest New Mexico
and the Mesa Verde country of southwest Colorado, through the Bandelier
region, to the living towns of Cochiti to the south, San Ildefonso
to the northeast, and other local Indian communities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Ruins: Their Types and Extent</i></span></h2>
<p>The evidences of ancient human occupation in the Bandelier neighborhood
are apparent even to the most casual observer. When driving
over the approach road to the monument headquarters one cannot
fail to observe cave rooms in the cliffs on every hand; the continuing
spectacle of smoke-blackened chambers dug into the rock provides
the stimulus of discovery en route. But the roadside introduction is an
infinitesimal preview of the total scope of prehistoric man&rsquo;s activity in
the region. In actuality, all of the ruins contained within the national
monument represent but a small fraction of the ruins of the surrounding
plateau.</p>

<p>The entire eastern slope of the Jemez Mountains to the west, throughout
the zone of moderate elevations from 7,000 feet down to the Rio
Grande at 5,500 feet, appears to have been thickly settled in prehistoric
times; this eastern slope has been given the name of Pajarito
Plateau. The extent of the plateau is, very roughly, 30 miles north
to south, and 10 miles east to west (from the Rio Grande west to the
crest of the Jemez). From Santa Clara Creek on the north of the
monument to the Canada de Cochiti on the south of the monument,
this tract of forested mesas and canyons contains Indian ruins which, if
not innumerable, at least at this writing have not yet been totaled. It
perhaps may be said, to emphasize the concentration of these ruins,
that an observant person can hardly walk a quarter of a mile in any
direction through the once-inhabited zone without noticing some sort
of ancient structure or handiwork of prehistoric man.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Base of a cliff of volcanic tuff, showing several cave rooms.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The habitations of the early people were of two types, basically:
the cliff or cave dwelling, and the masonry or open pueblo structure.
But these two types were frequently blended into composite dwellings,
part cave and part masonry, wherein a cliff formed the back
wall of the building. It is this third type, called a talus house, which
is conspicuous along the canyon sides within and near the national
monument.</p>
<p>The rock which forms the walls of all the Pajarito canyons is a
cemented volcanic ash called tuff, with many erosion cavities which
can be readily enlarged with tools of hard stone. It might be logical to
assume that early migrants to the Pajarito country, 700 years ago,
first took shelter in the natural cavities, then presently improved these
crude holes into more livable chambers. There is, however, no evidence
to support the idea that the cave rooms were lived in first. In
fact, some authorities reason that since the firstcomers had been living
in masonry dwellings in their earlier homes, they would first have
built the familiar communal buildings on arrival here, leaving the
caves to be taken up later by overflow population.</p>
<p>Whatever the sequence of construction, many thousands of cave
rooms were prepared, involving the removal of thousands of cubic
yards of tuff&mdash;an industrious people, these. Although some rooms
are found with a long dimension of over 10 feet, the great majority
of them are smaller. A typical room measures about 6 by 9 feet,
with ceiling height perhaps 5 feet, 8 inches. Such a chamber has
a doorway not over 3 feet high and only half as wide; there is an
opening or two in the front wall near the ceiling to permit escape of
smoke; and there may be a corresponding hole at floor level near the
door to admit a draft of air to the fireplace. The appointments of the
typical home are completed with a cupboard niche dug into the rear
wall, a coat of mud plaster on floor and walls, and a covering of soot
all over the ceiling&mdash;this last an inescapable penalty of cave living.</p>
<p>A room of such size might have provided sleeping quarters for a
family of 5 or 6, considering the fact that no furniture took up space
within. Frequently two cave rooms are found connected by a doorway
cut through the interior wall, suggesting the expansion of a
family beyond the limits of a single room.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The ruins of Long House, once a dwelling of some 300 rooms.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The most impressive ruins of the Pajarito country are the remains of
communal masonry dwellings of pueblo architecture. (Pueblo is
Spanish for village or town. The first Spanish explorers applied the
word to the permanent dwellings or settlements of farming Indians;
by association, the word pueblo has come to designate also the builders
of these dwellings and their modern Indian successors.) At least one
of these great buildings contained over 600 rooms; there are several
which had over 500 rooms, to a height of 3 stories. These multistory
towns were built of the local tuff, shattered and pecked into convenient
size for masonry use, and laid with mud mortar. The great houses
were situated both on mesa-tops and in canyon bottoms; some were
designed as hollow squares or circles, others had only a haphazard
ground plan. None of these dwellings today is more than one story
high, so that their original height is unknown in detail, but great
massivity and considerable defensive strength are apparent even from
the remaining mounds of rubble.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/pmg008.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="488" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The unexcavated ruin of Yapashi.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The rooms of the community houses were scarcely larger than the
cave rooms already described; almost none of the surviving ground-floor
rooms are more than 10 by 12 feet, and the typical room measures
perhaps 7 by 10 feet. These chambers were quite dark and unventilated,
since there were almost no windows or even connecting doorways
between rooms; almost every room of the ground floor was
entered by a ladder through an opening in its ceiling. It is conjectured
that these first-floor cells were designed in this fashion to serve as
storage places for foodstuffs, more secure from rodents by reason of
having only one opening in the roof. Moreover, the lower-floor walls
were a stronger foundation for the upper floors when built without door
or window openings. Finally, this design provided maximum security
for defense against human marauders.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that a composite type of building, combining
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
cave rooms and masonry walls, is common in the area. This sort of
construction was responsible for the many rows of small holes still to be
seen in the cliffs, evenly spaced some 2 feet apart above the cave doorways.
These holes were cut and used as sockets to support the ends of
roof beams extending forward from the cliff and providing ceilings
for the masonry rooms which once stood there. These evenly spaced
holes, which you first see along many of the canyon walls, give mute
evidence of the early aboriginal occupation of this area. Many of
these talus dwellings reached a height of 3 stories and pushed out
from the cliff 3 and 4 rooms deep, so that the cave rooms which were
occupied first became relegated to storage space in the dark rear
interiors.</p>
<p>To conclude this general summation of ruin types, some description
should be made of kivas. Kivas were, and are, the ceremonial
chambers of the Pueblo people; as such, they are universally present
in the Pajarito communities and their design makes them identifiable
even in the ruined state. The local kivas were always round and
were dug almost full-depth into the ground, except for certain examples
which were excavated into the relatively soft bedrock of cliff or
mesa-top. The circular depressions still to be found in the plazas of
the great communal houses are the remains of kivas with their roofs
collapsed and with the wind-borne debris of centuries accumulated in
the hollows. A more complete discussion of kivas and their functions
will be found on <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small"><i>Principal Ruins of the National Monument</i></span></h2>
<p>Bandelier National Monument is divided into two parcels of land:
the Otowi section of about 9 square miles and the Frijoles section of
nearly 33 square miles. Within these two areas are contained great
concentrations of ruins, including several of the largest on the plateau.
A number of the Bandelier ruins have been excavated, so there is
quite a detailed knowledge of the culture which once flourished on the
monument lands.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Tyuonyi Ruin, with the Big Kiva at left rear, and the trees of the campground at top of the picture.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The most frequently visited part of the monument is the canyon of
the Rito de los Frijoles, wherein is located the monument headquarters.
In this well-watered and wooded canyon are to be found ruins of the
three types described above, which had well over 1,000 rooms in their
prime some 500 years ago. Here also is the excavated remnant of the
largest kiva found anywhere in the Pajarito country&mdash;a chamber which
perhaps was the community center of religious practice for the entire
canyon.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c3">TYUONYI.</h3>
<p>On the floor of Frijoles Canyon, a little upstream from the
headquarters museum, is Tyuonyi, the chief building of the area, and
one of the most impressive pueblo ruins in the Rio Grande drainage.
Situated on a level bench of open ground, perhaps 100 feet from the
Rito and 15 feet above the water, Tyuonyi at one time contained over
400 rooms, to a height of 3 stories in part. Its modern aspect is greatly
reduced in height; although excavated, no walls have been restored,
so that only the ground floor is still evident, with outer and inner walls
standing to a height of 4 or 5 feet throughout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/pmg011.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The ruins trail; the south rim of Frijoles Canyon shows in the background.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>To appreciate the size and lay-out of Tyuonyi, you should climb the
nearby slope until a bird&rsquo;s-eye view reveals the entire ground plan of
the huge circle. From above, more than 250 rooms can be counted,
placed in concentric rows around a central plaza. The most massive
part of the circle is 8 rooms across, narrowing to 4 rooms in breadth at
the brook side. The 2- and 3-story parts of the building, as computed
from the height of the original rubble, were at the massive eastern side.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of Tyuonyi is the entrance passage
through the eastern part of the circle. This passage was apparently
the only access to the central plaza, other than by ladders across the
rooftops. An arrangement of this sort, of course, suggests a concern
for defensive strength on the part of Tyuonyi&rsquo;s builders; certainly the
circle of windowless, doorless walls would have presented a problem
to attackers, once the ladders were drawn up and the single passageway
blocked.</p>
<p>It is believed that a good part of the first-floor rooms of Tyuonyi
were storage chambers of the type previously discussed. This belief
is borne out by the fact that during excavation many of these rooms
were found to be without fireplaces, a condition which would have
made such rooms unlivable in cold weather. The problem of smoke
clearance was very serious in the larger pueblos, since the builders had
no knowledge of modern fireplaces with chimney flues; hence the
building of fires on the lower floors of multistory buildings worked a
hardship on upstairs occupants and must have been avoided whenever
possible.</p>
<p>The age of the Tyuonyi construction has been fairly well established
by the tree-ring method of dating, so widely and successfully used by
archeologists in the Southwest. Ceiling-beam fragments recovered
from various rooms give dates between A. D. 1383 and 1466. This
general period seems to have been a time of much building in Frijoles
Canyon; a score of tree-ring dates from Rainbow House ruin, which is
down the canyon a half mile, fall in the early and middle 1400&rsquo;s. Perhaps
the last construction anywhere in Frijoles Canyon occurred close
to A. D. 1500, with a peak of population reached near that time or
shortly thereafter.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c4">TALUS HOUSE.</h3>
<p>On the talus directly above Tyuonyi to the north, at the
foot of the prominent cliff, there once stood a cluster of houses. The
group here had as its nucleus 12 or 15 cave rooms which were supplemented
by at least as many masonry rooms at the front. Excavation
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of these rooms was completed in 1909 and the name Sun House was
given to the building, because of a prominent Sun-symbol petroglyph
carved on the cliff above. A part of this house group has been restored
on the old foundations, with its new ceiling beams placed in the ancient
holes in the cliff. This restoration work, done by the Museum of New
Mexico in 1920, serves to show faithfully the original appearance of
this typical specimen of a talus house. Here again the rooms are small
(by modern standards) with doors only large enough to squeeze
through, and no windows. During the 1400&rsquo;s, it is probable that
several such dwellings were occupied along a 2-mile stretch of this cliff.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/pmg012.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="682" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A restored talus house.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c5">LONG HOUSE.</h3>
<p>About one-fourth of a mile up the canyon from Tyuonyi,
also against the northern and sun-warmed cliff, is the ruin of one of the
largest combination cave-and-masonry dwellings to be found anywhere
on the plateau. This great ruin is known as Long House for an obvious
reason&mdash;it stretches almost 800 feet in a continuous block of rooms.
For all of this distance, the masonry walls are backed by a sheer and
largely smooth wall of tuff some 150 feet high. Into this cliff are dug
many cave rooms, several kivas, and a variety of storage niches, all of
which were incorporated into a single dwelling of over 300 rooms,
rising 3 stories high. At Long House the rows of viga (roof-beam)
holes in the cliff are particularly conspicuous, defining the onetime
roof levels for hundreds of feet at a stretch. The site of Long House is
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
especially pleasing, having an elevation of 40 or 50 feet above the canyon
bottom, but close enough to the creek so that the sound of running
water may be heard, and near enough to the huge stream-bordering
cottonwoods to partake of the coolness of their foliage. If it is conceivable
to envy any of the people of prehistoric times, surely we should
envy the dwellers of Long House.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c6">KIVAS.</h3>
<p>Associated with the numerous ruins in Frijoles Canyon are
various kivas, both in the canyon floor and in the cliffs. The large
kiva previously mentioned is a short distance east of Tyuonyi, very
nearly in the center of the widest part of the canyon floor. The rock-walled
circular pit is 42 feet across and 8 feet deep, with a ventilation
shaft at the east side and a narrow entranceway opposite. When the
roof was intact above the chamber, there must have been little evidence
of the existence of the subterranean room; perhaps a ladder protruding
from a center hole in the roof was the only conspicuous indication
of the kiva below. In its present and partially restored state, this kiva
shows the butt ends of six roof columns similar to those which once
bore the load of the roof, as well as the stub ends of roof stringers.
The restoration work in this kiva was accomplished by the Civilian
Conservation Corps, which was responsible for much valuable work
in the monument during the late 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Of particular interest in Frijoles Canyon are the unique kivas in the
cliffs. Of the thousands of kivas found throughout the ancient land
of the pueblos, there are no others of this cave style. The largest of
the cave kivas in the monument is a few hundred feet north of
Tyuonyi, at the base of a fantastically eroded block of tuff. The oval
chamber, nearly 20 feet across its long dimension, has been restored
by the replacement of rock work around its doorway and ventilation
openings. The interior effect now presented, with soot-blackened
ceiling, mud-plastered lower walls, and looms set in their ancient
positions, must closely approximate the appearance of the kiva in the
days when it was used. Many such kivas were decorated with painted
or incised designs on the plaster of the walls. Although this particular
kiva does not show evidence of mural paintings, it does still contain
scratched designs in the plaster, unidentifiable because covered in part
by later replastering.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c7">CEREMONIAL CAVE.</h3>
<p>A restored kiva of very different type may be found
up the canyon nearly a mile. By climbing a series of ladders to a ledge
150 feet above the stream, the great rock overhang known as
Ceremonial Cave can be reached. Under the shelter of this arch a
number of masonry dwellings and a kiva were once built; the subterranean
kiva, excavated and reroofed, is very small but would have
served the needs of the few families who lived on this impregnable
balcony.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c8">STONE LIONS.</h3>
<p>Other noteworthy remains of the monument area lie outside
Frijoles Canyon, accessible only by foot or horse trail across the
mesas to the south. Perhaps the most frequently visited of these antiquities
is the shrine of the Stone Lions, 10 miles from monument
headquarters. Here on the mesa-top near an extensive ruin are two
life-size crouching mountain lion effigies carved side by side out of the
soft bedrock. This work of sculpture must have been accomplished
many centuries ago, for long weathering and erosion have left small
semblance of a true likeness. The shrine here is known to modern
Indians, being visited occasionally by hunters who leave prayer offerings
for success in their hunt. A second pair of stone lions was carved
on a mesa-top several miles to the south, outside the monument boundary.
These two pairs of life-size stone effigies are unique in the Southwest.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c9">PAINTED CAVE.</h3>
<p>A final feature of particular interest in the back country
of the monument is the Painted Cave. This art gallery in the cliffs
decorates a canyon wall some 12 miles from headquarters. Once a
large population inhabited this canyon of Capulin Creek, but most of
the evidences of habitation have vanished except for the extensive
pictographs on the weatherproof back wall of the Painted Cave. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
arch of the cave is shallow but wide, so that a smooth area over 50
feet long was available to the artists; several dozen drawings in a
variety of reds and blacks adorn this surface. It is probable that many
generations of artists used the cave, since space finally ran out and
later drawings are superimposed on their faded predecessors. Moreover,
evidence of historic, or post-Spanish, artistry is here&mdash;a sketch of
a conquistador on horseback, another of a mission church complete
with cross.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c10">OTOWI.</h3>
<p>The smaller section of Bandelier National Monument, lying
some 15 miles from the headquarters area, takes its name from the
Otowi ruin, the largest pueblo on the monument. Although not so
impressive as the Tyuonyi ruin at first glance, the great spread and
complexity of the rubble mounds surely dwarf all other ruined dwellings
of the vicinity. Probably 450 ground-floor rooms were here, with
an indeterminate number of upper-floor rooms&mdash;perhaps 600 rooms
altogether is a reasonable estimate. The Otowi rooms have not been
excavated to any great extent, but two burial mounds south of the
building group have been investigated with spectacular results&mdash;over
150 interments were found in a space about 80 by 100 feet. With these
burials was found a great variety of offerings to the dead, ranging from
food bowls to bone awls and ceremonial pipes. Specimens of these
handicrafts may be seen at the National Park Service museum at monument
headquarters and at the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c11">TSANKAWI.</h3>
<p>The Otowi house-group occupies a site atop a low ridge
walled in by the cliffsides of steep Pueblo Canyon. Its nearest neighbor,
Tsankawi, is sited on a very different terrain: Tsankawi is very
near to being a &ldquo;sky-city&rdquo; in the style of the modern Acoma in western
New Mexico. Not as large as Otowi, this ruin has equal majesty by
reason of its commanding position on top of a cliff-ringed island
mesa overlooking a vast north-south sweep of the Rio Grande and the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains beyond. The location and the ground
plan suggest defense as a first consideration. Of masonry construction
in a rough hollow square, Tsankawi would have presented a serious
problem to enemy besiegers. On the other hand, a siege would have
cut off the defenders from their water supply, far in the canyon below.
There is, however, some evidence of a rain-catchment basin close outside
the eastern walls, and excavation may in future confirm the existence
of an ingenious water-storage system.</p>
<p>The most memorable sight at Tsankawi lies along the trail that
climbs from the end of the access road to the mesa-top. Here for 100
yards the path, crossing a bald slope of soft gray tuff, is worn down for
almost 18 inches by the climbing and descending feet of thousands of
Indian passersby. Granted that the rock is extremely porous and soft,
it is nonetheless almost beyond the scope of imagination to conceive
the vast traffic required to so entrench the path. Today, when you
climb this trail, you cannot but visualize a procession of Indian farmers
over several generations traveling to and from their fields, their
sandaled feet scuffing each year a fractional inch deeper into the
calendar of the rock.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><br /><span class="small"><i>Origins of the People</i></span></h2>
<p>The great number of Indian ruins in the Bandelier vicinity, some of
which have been described, give evidence of the presence and
labor of thousands of prehistoric people. Who were these people?
Whence did they come, and where have they gone? A myriad of
questions is inspired by the far-flung ruins&mdash;and in the ruins, of course,
are the answers to these questions, answers which have been gradually
unearthed by scientists over the past 75 years. Beginning with Adolph
Bandelier, the Swiss-American ethnologist for whom the monument is
named, a succession of scientists has brought to light many facts once
buried beneath the rubble of the ruins.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c13">WORK OF THE ARCHEOLOGISTS.</h3>
<p>Before entering upon a description of the
life and times of the early Bandelier dwellers, it may be well to discuss
briefly the efforts of the archeologists and others who have built up the
picture of this long-lost culture. The work of the archeologist is
essentially historical detective work&mdash;in his digging and searching he
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
must find, assemble, and interpret clues. Some of these clues will be
tangible, like pottery fragments. Other clues will be intangible&mdash;the
very absence of pottery fragments in an ancient dwelling tells a story.
The correct evaluation and interpretation of multitudinous clues by
many experts over two generations have at last given us a very considerable
knowledge of Southwestern prehistory&mdash;and the knowledge
is being added to daily. H. M. Wormington, in <i>Prehistoric Indians of
the Southwest</i>, wrote &ldquo;... the development of archaeology in the
Southwest may be compared to the putting together of a great jig-saw
puzzle. First came a period of general examination of the pieces, then
a concentration on the larger and more highly colored pieces, and
finally a carefully planned approach to the puzzle as a whole with
serious attempts to fill in specific blank areas.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14">THE BASKETMAKERS AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL PUEBLO PERIOD.</h3>
<p>As a result
of such concerted study and deduction, there exists today a fairly
solid understanding of the general course of human events in the
Southwest for the past 2,000 years. Many details are still missing,
and some will always be, but the general outline of Indian life and
customs is established back to the early centuries of the Christian era;
beyond that, the picture becomes hazy. Those earlier years were
seemingly times of a seminomadic, hunting-gathering existence for
the early Southwesterners; only from about 3,000 years ago is there
clear evidence of the advent of intensive farming and a settled life.</p>
<p>As soon as agriculture became their primary sustenance, the people
began to live more or less permanently in one place. From certain early
cave-shelters are derived the clues which begin to formulate the story
of the days before history. Human burials have been found in the
earth floors of shallow caves scattered through the San Juan river
drainage; and in these same caves are found storage chambers prepared
to protect the foodstuffs, principally corn. Their outstanding
handicraft was basketry, as far as remaining evidence shows. Because
of the great numbers of skilfully worked baskets found in their homesites,
archeologists have named these people Basketmakers. It is now
quite certain that the Indians who came much later to live in the
Bandelier vicinity can claim as ancestors the Basketmaker people of the
area to the west.</p>
<p>The life of these ancestral farmers was a primitive one, even by the
standards which prevailed in Frijoles Canyon 1,000 years later. For
one thing, no permanent dwellings appear to have been constructed
until late in Basketmaker times, and even then dwellings were of crude
pithouse type&mdash;an excavation some 3 feet into the ground, walled up
and roofed with logs, brush, and earth. Further, the bow and arrow
was not used by these people until perhaps A. D. 600; the early weapon
of hunting and warfare was the spear and spear-thrower (atlatl).
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
For the greater part of Basketmaker times, pottery was unknown;
only after A. D. 400 was true fired pottery introduced in the northern
Southwest.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="pcap"><i>Typical prehistoric pottery vessels made in the Bandelier vicinity.</i>

</div>
<p>The production of decorated pottery late in Basketmaker times
began a development which has had the greatest archeological significance.
The long-enduring fragments of painted pottery found in
subsequent housesites have been a principal tool by which students
have pieced together the relative chronology of ruins and the
migrations of the pottery-makers.</p>
<p>With successive introduction of pottery, the bow and arrow, and
other new traits in the approximate period A. D. 450 to 750, the
character of Basketmaker life became so modified that a new name&mdash;the
Pueblos&mdash;was applied to the subsequent peoples. Presently they
began to move from the Basketmaker pithouse into masonry chambers
above ground, perhaps with several rooms connected, the old pithouse
surviving in use as the ceremonial kiva. Cotton came under cultivation
and was woven into garments. Hoes and axes of stone with
serviceable handles came into use. Turkeys and dogs were by this
time commonly domesticated, the former being valued primarily for
feathers which served to make warm robes and ceremonial garb.</p>

<p>The stage was now set for the great flowering of
the Pueblo people; the way of life which had taken rough shape from
A. D. 450 to 1050 now reached culmination in the Great Pueblo period.
For about 200 years, or until around A. D. 1250, fortune smiled on the
farming towns of the Four Corners country. The population grew
and spread, and the handicraft arts reached a stage of impressive
proficiency. The centers of this classic period which are today best
known lie in three different States: Mesa Verde (in Mesa Verde National
Park, Colo.), Chaco Canyon (in Chaco Canyon National Monument,
N. Mex.), and the vicinity of Betatakin and Keet Seel (in Navajo
National Monument, Ariz.) These three areas, all now under the
jurisdiction of the National Park Service, contain the great cliff dwellings
and communal houses which mark the highest development of
prehistoric Indian attainments in the northern Southwest.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this handbook to present an adequate description
of the Great Pueblo towns and their inhabitants. Although
almost contemporaneous, the three largest centers differed greatly in
development, so that the total story becomes most complex. In general
it may be said that the skills of farming and production of foodstuffs
became highly efficient, allowing the people more leisure in
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
which to experiment with and improve their arts and crafts and their
ceremonial rituals. Much elaboration and refinement of the potter&rsquo;s
craft, for example, is traceable to these years; some of the world&rsquo;s finest
ceramic art, ancient or modern, comes from Chaco Canyon and the
Mesa Verde. Again, in the field of jewelry-making and personal
adornment, the craftsman of the 1100&rsquo;s produced shell- and turquoise-inlay
work which would have earned the admiration of Cellini.
Finally, a multiplicity of kivas is to be found in all the great houses of
the period, as well as a number of Great Kivas embodying various
elaborate altar features. This expenditure of effort to crowd the towns
with ceremonial rooms would seem to indicate something of a preoccupation
with religion. The numerous discoveries of carved stone
fetishes and other ceremonial objects serve to bear out a concept of
elaborate ritual and unending dedication to the service of their gods.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c16">DROUGHT AND MIGRATIONS.</h3>
<p>It seems, however, that the gods were fickle.
Some two centuries of growth and prosperity were all that were to be
allowed the farmers of the Great Pueblo centers. In the last quarter of
the 13th century, a period of drought came to the high plateaus of the
Pueblo people. From the evidence of the tree rings of the time, the
majority of the years between A. D. 1276 and 1299 were so deficient in
rainfall that the Indian corn crops could not have matured. Although
this drought was not actually continuous, and varied between regions,
there was undoubtedly much starvation, and a decimation of the inhabitants
of the great towns, perhaps from enemy raids as well as
hunger. There were undoubtedly numerous migrations from the
drought-stricken areas into places with reliable streams.</p>
<p>These troubled times in the western centers and emigrations therefrom
were responsible in large part for the settling of the Pajarito Plateau
and the canyons of what is now Bandelier National Monument.
The streams of the Jemez Mountains continued to flow during the
dry time, apparently, for large-scale colonization of well-watered canyons
such as Frijoles appears to date from the end of the 13th century.
The drift of the emigrants from the western areas is impossible to
trace in detail, continuing as it did for several generations and originating
from many sources. The Bandelier region may have been
something of a melting pot, assimilating migrants from various distant
places. A study of the pottery types produced in the early days of
residence here affords the best clue to possible origins. Among these
types are found precise copies of decoration styles from a number of
the western centers, indicating that the women potters carried on their
respective traditional decorations upon arrival in their new homes.
One particular kind of black-on-white pottery can hardly be distinguished
even by microscopic examination from a similar ware made
in the Mesa Verde country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c17">LATE PUEBLO PERIOD.</h3>
<p>The upsurge of population and the main construction
activity in Bandelier began after A. D. 1300. Large towns
grew up and down the Rio Grande drainage, and their people achieved
in most respects as high a standard of living as their forebears had
known in the Great Pueblo centers of 200 years earlier. Very possibly
the Rio Grande pueblos might have gone ahead to a new peak of cultural
development if they had not been interrupted and demoralized
by the coming of the Spanish. In 1598, some 400 farmers and soldiers
led by Don Juan de Onate, the first permanent Spanish settlers, came
from Mexico, and with the entry of these land-seekers the ascendancy
of the Pueblos was finished.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><br /><span class="small"><i>Life of the Early People at Bandelier</i></span></h2>
<p>The typical male inhabitant of Frijoles Canyon in the early 1300&rsquo;s, then,
was a newcomer to the area. He was a man of Mongoloid cast of
countenance, about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches in height, with medium red-brown
skin and black hair. His wife measured 5 feet or perhaps a
little less, and was inclined to a stout build. A few children and a dog
or two completed the family circle. These newcomers had arrived in
their chosen valley with only such belongings as they could carry on
their backs, and were immediately faced with the problems of wresting
a livelihood from a somewhat grudging environment. In the pattern
of all mankind before and since, this Indian migrant&rsquo;s first requirements
were food, water, shelter, and clothing for himself and his
family.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c19">FOOD.</h3>
<p>As a practicing farmer, the man&rsquo;s chief reliance for food had
been the crops of corn, beans, and squash that he knew how to raise.
Perhaps the family had managed to bring some remnants of their most
recent harvests with them to Frijoles; but these remnants had to be
saved for seed, to insure crops for the coming year. What did the
family eat meanwhile? In the warm season, a diet of sorts could have
been pieced together by gathering various plants and fruit and nut
crops. Spring brought out of the ground several annuals such as the
mustard and bee plants which can be boiled for vegetable-greens while
young. A bit later the local berry crop came into fruit&mdash;currants,
gooseberries, chokecherries, and a few raspberries. The ever-present
yucca offered its bananalike pod of fruit toward August. When fall
arrived, the countryside, in good years, abounded with wild produce:
pinyon-nuts and juniper berries, the staples, with trimmings of prickly
pears, acorns, and many other seed and nut crops. The ingenuity of
the modern Pueblo Indian in coaxing sustenance out of his familiar
native plants is extraordinary; very few things that grow are not of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
some use to him as food or medicine. It may surely be assumed that
the Pueblo ancestor of 600 years ago was equally resourceful.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/pmg020.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="588" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Ancient sandals, made from yucca leaves.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Fortunately, however, this ancient Frijoles resident was not restricted
to the collection of wild crops to feed his family. He was a hunter
as well as a gatherer. He was armed with bow and arrow, and was
undoubtedly an expert shot. Other tools were snares and nets for
small game and birds. If he did not bring cordage with him on his
migration he promptly wove it from the useful yucca plant, and set
out a trapline. Many small animals which moderns would disdain
were important food items to the early Pueblos: the once-common
prairie dog and the still-common pack rat were eaten in great numbers,
if the evidence of bones in ancient trash heaps can be believed. Perhaps
only the skunk escaped the designs of the early food-seeker, for a
reason which was as valid then as it is today. Of larger animals, the
deer was most taken, although elk and antelope were not immune.
The remains of game pits, dug into the soft bedrock to entrap larger
beasts, have been found in several places in the monument. One of
these pits is 15 feet deep with a bottom diameter of 8 feet, narrowing
to a smaller bottleneck opening above. The preparation of such a trap
as this was obviously a laborious community enterprise, and suggests
an occasional community deer-drive to herd the victims across the
concealed mouth of the pit.</p>
<p>All this work of hunting and gathering was secondary to planting
and tending crops, once the growing season arrived. The Pueblos had
discovered, many centuries before, that their best defense against hunger
was in growing corn&mdash;so the Frijoles hunter became a farmer in
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
late May or June. With digging stick and stone hoe, he prepared the
ground to grow his corn, beans, and squash. Not only were the moist
canyon bottoms thus cultivated, but also the mesa-tops wherever a
sufficient depth of soil had accumulated. This agriculture was not
assisted by irrigation systems of any sort that have been discovered
here, although irrigation was practiced on the Mesa Verde a century
earlier. Apparently the local rains in summer were adequate in Frijoles
to bring a crop to maturity. Climatologists believe that there was a
little more precipitation over most of the Southwest 500 years ago than
there is today, and possibly the ancient corn was more drought-resistant.
In any case, in good years the local farmer managed to harvest enough
of his three crops in September to tide his family over the privations
of winter&mdash;if no human marauders descended to loot the granary.</p>
<p>The harvesting of the corn by no means concluded the labors concerned
with it. A place of storage safe from rodents was a first
requisite, bringing about the building of tight-walled chambers both
in the cliffs and in the pueblo understory; then long grinding with
stone metate and mano on the part of the housewife was called for
to convert the kernels to cornmeal. One ancient use of this cornmeal
no doubt is duplicated in the modern Pueblo cooking of Piki&mdash;a thin
crisp paperlike bread baked on a hot stone griddle. Traces of such
griddle-stoves are to be found in some of the ancient pueblos.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c20">SHELTER.</h3>
<p>With his food needs taken care of, the new Frijoles resident
thought next of shelter from the weather. Either he organized with
some of his neighbors to construct a masonry dwelling in the traditional
style of the west country, or he took shelter in a natural cave
of the tuff cliff. In the latter case, a few days of scraping and chipping
at the soft rock would normally suffice to level off the floor and raise
the ceiling; final trimmings, such as fireplace and rocked-up doorway,
could be completed at leisure. As years passed and the family grew,
it may be assumed that the sooty cave became crowded and was supplemented
with rooms in front, built up from rock fragments lying close
by, mortared together with adobe from down the slope. For ceiling
beams, pinyons and junipers were large enough, since the span needed
to be only 6 or 8 feet; even these small timbers were hard enough to
cut and trim with a stone axe. Above the beams, small sticks, mostly
willow, were tightly laid, then grass or bark was spread to take the
final layer of earth which weatherproofed the ceiling, or which made
the floor for the room above. The design of the ceilings in the
modern buildings at monument headquarters is of this type, a style
of Pueblo architecture, largely derived from ancient Indian models,
which is commonly seen throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>It is uncertain which type of construction is the older&mdash;the talus
house or the open pueblo on the canyon floor. But one thing is evident&mdash;a
building of the size of Tyuonyi, previously described, was
worked on and occupied by scores of families. In troubled times, this
massive structure would have served better for mutual defense than
scattered or smaller houses.</p>
<p>The rock of which the Bandelier masonry walls were made is not
an easy material to build with. Unlike sandstone or even limestone,
it refuses to fracture into clean straight lines or right angles. To employ
it as building stone, the Indians had to find small miscellaneous
blocks and chip these odd pieces into some semblance of usable shape.
This chipping or pecking was done with hammerstones and axes of
harder lava. The work required to fashion the walls of Tyuonyi,
crude though they are, must have been prodigious.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c21">CLOTHING.</h3>
<p>The third basic requirement of the Frijoles newcomer was
clothing, particularly warm clothing to combat the winter. Traveling
into this area in the warm months, presumably, he may or may not
have been able to bring along a full cold-weather wardrobe. If he
did not, the materials to contrive warm clothes were available
here for the taking. Ingenuity and work would have produced the
necessary garments.</p>
<p>The obvious coverings were skins and hides of the game animals
which the hunters collected. A bear skin was a most desirable cold-weather
protection&mdash;but there were certainly never enough bear in
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
this part of the country to take care of all the Indian needs. Other
long-haired animals, such as wolf, coyote, fox, and bobcat, no doubt
played a minor part in the clothing schemes of the local people. But
the real mainstay of fur-robe manufacture, of which there is
fragmentary evidence in many ruins, was the lowly rabbit.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/pmg022.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="537" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Frijoles Canyon and the Jemez Mountains.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Rabbit skins apparently were not used in one piece, but rather were
cut into long strips about one-quarter inch wide. These strips were
then spirally wound about a core of yucca-fiber rope, the resulting fur
cable being woven by loose twining into a pliant and comfortable
blanket. The same technique was used with turkey feathers to produce
an equally warm and much lighter-weight garment. The Bandelier
people for many years domesticated the wild turkey in order to
have an abundant supply of feathers, both for utilitarian and
ceremonial garments.</p>
<p>Summer clothing was most conspicuous by its near absence. Since
about A. D. 700, however, the Pueblo world had known cotton and
had developed considerable skill in weaving it, so that the Frijoles
dweller of the 1300&rsquo;s was able to produce such fabric as he required
from cotton, which could be obtained by trade with low-country
people only 50 miles down the Rio Grande. Weaving techniques have
apparently been passed down to the modern Pueblo people from their
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
prehistoric ancestors. Present-day Pueblo men, particularly in the
Hopi towns of Arizona, produce cotton blankets, belts, and ceremonial
clothing of a very high standard, on looms of the ancient type.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">

<p class="pcap"><i>A pinyon-juniper woodland in winter.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The items of wearing apparel most important to the early people,
perhaps, were sandals. In the Southwest it is difficult, if not out of the
question, to go barefoot outdoors; even the toughened Indian feet
could not have been impervious to cactus spines. A great deal of time
and skill was expended, therefore, in the devising of footgear. From
the days of the Basketmakers, the sandal most in favor had been woven
of yucca, the plant with slender swordlike leaves sometimes known
as Spanish-bayonet. Yucca is to be found in one species or another
throughout the one-time land of the Pueblos. Such intensive use was
made of it by the early people that it is almost surprising that it could
have survived. As mentioned previously, yucca was the favorite fiber
for cordage, and essentially it was cordage which made up the best
types of sandals. A twilled weave of small-diameter cords was carefully
shaped to the foot, the edges were neatly bound, then lashings
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
to tie around the ankle and over the toes were made to finish the job.
A sole of this sort was durable and had remarkable nonskid qualities,
as anyone who has worn modern rope-soled shoes can testify. Cruder,
more quickly made sandals were plaited together from the unworked
blades of the narrow-leaf yucca, the resulting weave looking rather
like modern palm-frond matting.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Mule deer.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c22">RELIGION.</h3>
<p>It has been said that &ldquo;Man cannot live by bread alone.&rdquo;
Nowhere is the truth of this better illustrated than in the history of the
Pueblo Indian who, in spite of appalling difficulties to achieve the
physical sustenance of life, found much time to develop a spiritual
life. The principal evidences of a widespread ancient religion are,
of course, the remains of kivas, found in all the old communities.
Although details of the use of prehistoric kivas cannot be established,
some ideas of their use can be inferred from the part that kivas play in
the modern Pueblo religion. The kiva rituals practiced today are
traditional in the highest degree, and in all likelihood have descended
in their basic form from centuries-old origins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Hence it is perhaps valid to assume that the following conditions
prevailed here at Bandelier 600 years ago: The principal social and
religious organization was a society or clan; each such organization
had its own kiva; and in their kiva the men of the group conducted
ceremonies to honor and propitiate many deities, which were personified
in birds and beasts, the elements, and natural forces.</p>
<p>Certain parts of these ceremonies were very likely performed outside
the kiva, so that others of the village might also participate&mdash;and
thus originated the spectacular public dance dramas which visitors
nowadays so greatly enjoy at the modern pueblos. Indian dances,
as the 20th-century Southwest knows them, are usually short-term
public displays of long-term private rituals entailing days of prayer
and chanting in the privacy of the kiva. The best known of these
Pueblo ceremonies is chiefly a prayer for rain&mdash;The Hopi Snake Dance.
Others may be prayers for success in the hunt, for productivity of
crops, or for healing the sick.</p>
<p>The complexity of the Pueblo religion is increased by the fact that
it is indivisibly allied to social and family organization. In the Pueblo
scheme of worship, there is not, and seemingly never was, any elite
group of &ldquo;medicine men&rdquo; or chief practitioners of religion; each person
has a part in religious observances, his respective role growing more
important as he advances in seniority within a ceremonial organization.
With responsibility for the conduct of worship thus placed on
all the people, religion is an extremely pervasive force and enters into
much of the daily life of each individual.</p>

<h3 class="inline">A CAUTION.</h3>
<p>In the foregoing attempt to portray the origins and modes
of life of the Bandelier dwellers, it has been necessary to generalize
and abbreviate to a degree which may occasionally lead a reader
astray. Particularly in the matter of dating periods of habitation and
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
migration, it has been impossible to detail the many exceptions to the
general chronology. It is suggested that the reader who wishes to
investigate further the history of the Pueblo people make reference
to the publications included in the list on pages <a href="#Page_43">43</a>-44. These represent,
of course, only a small fraction of the written material which exists on
the subject. Further publication of new findings will increase our
knowledge and alter present-day ideas as the years go by.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Natural Scene</i></span></h2>
<p>The countryside in and around Bandelier National Monument is
wholly forested and even in dry months is cool and green. Lying at
an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet, about one-third of the monument
receives sufficient rain and snow to support a handsome stand of ponderosa
pine. Over the remaining two-thirds of the area, where the
slopes are too warm and dry for the big pine, the hardy pinyon pine
and the juniper produce the &ldquo;pygmy forest&rdquo; growth common in the
middle elevations of the Southwest.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c24">CLIMATE.</h3>
<p>Summer at Bandelier is the shower season. From the first
of July until well into September, there is an impressive display of
lofty cumulus clouds and thunderheads almost every afternoon. Fortunately
for your comfort, these cloud displays do not always result in
showers on the monument every day. As is the habit of southwestern
thunderstorms, the rains usually cling to the higher peaks, leaving the
midelevations cooled but not drenched. The spring and fall are relatively
dry seasons, when the skies may remain entirely cloudless for
weeks at a time.</p>
<p>In the fall, the great range of temperature from night to day is
particularly noticeable; at monument headquarters a difference of 50&deg;
between afternoon high and night low is not unusual. This condition
is still evident even in midwinter, when the sun may send the thermometer
up far above freezing even after a below-zero night. Partly for
this reason, the snows of winter at Bandelier are not long-lasting. The
usual snowfall of a few inches will quite commonly melt away in a
day or so after the sun has returned. Even the snows of blizzard proportions
do not interfere for long with access to monument headquarters,
for the typical snow of New Mexico is light and dry, easily
cleared from the highways.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c25">LIFE ZONES.</h3>
<p>There is a great variety of herbs, shrubs, and trees within
the monument, as a result of the varied terrain and the range of elevation
from the bank of the Rio Grande up to the summit of the San
Miguel Mountains on the west boundary. Three life zones, or climatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
zones, are encountered in traveling the central part of the monument;
the Upper Sonoran zone of pinyon and juniper by the river, the Transition
Zone of ponderosa pines on the higher mesas, and, highest of all,
the Canadian Zone of spruce, fir, and aspen near Boundary Peak.
Each of these zones has its characteristic mammals and birds, so that
the population of wildlife is likewise varied and extensive.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">

<p class="pcap"><i>Group of cave rooms between Long House and Ceremonial Cave.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c26">WILDLIFE.</h3>
<p>Of the larger animals, the mule deer are most commonly
seen, becoming quite bold in Frijoles Canyon, where humans are
familiar to them. Black bears are encountered occasionally on the
trails in the back country, but are too wary to invade much-traveled
areas. The shyest of them all, the mountain lion, leaves his footprints
here and there, but is rarely seen. Smaller predators such as coyotes
and foxes are numerous, as is the bobcat. These small hunters get
most of their living from a large population of rabbits and small
rodents such as ground squirrels and wood rats. For the visitor, one
of the most popular wild residents is the tufted-eared Abert squirrel,
which circulates decoratively through the pines and cottonwoods of
the public campground during the summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="img" id="fig28">

<p class="pcap"><i>A cross section of sandstone overlain by lava, Frijoles Canyon.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The trees lining the Rito de los Frijoles through the Bandelier campground
are a haven for birds as well as squirrels. In some spots, the
shrubbery by the stream becomes jungle-thick, making a perfect small-bird
habitat. Probably the most common of the Frijoles Canyon
songbirds, after the robin, is the black-headed grosbeak. Next in
numbers comes the hermit thrush, followed by warblers, vireos, and
western tanagers. But the bird most commonly heard in the canyon,
and frequently seen around the ruins, is the canyon wren; the melody
of his song brings life and brightness to the crumbled walls and the
gloomy caves of the vanished people.</p>
<p>During the colder part of the year, the forests of Bandelier become
the home of flocks of wild turkeys. These great birds stay high on
the Jemez crest during the summer, but come down into the zone of
oaks and pinyons to feed on nuts and acorns when the crops ripen in
the fall. The turkeys are also very fond of the purple berries of the
juniper, as are many other birds and virtually all of the small rodents
of the locality.</p>
<p>Down along the Rio Grande, which makes the southeast boundary
for the main part of the monument, there is a rewarding variety of
plants and animals for those who wish to walk or ride horseback the
3 miles from headquarters. The river at this point is midway in its
passage through White Rock Canyon, a roadless stretch of steep walls
and boulder-strewn rapids. Here, the fringing willows and cottonwoods
are festooned with wild grape vines; these green tangles provide
food and shelter for a great community of birds, insects, and reptiles.
Flycatchers are everywhere over the river in the summer, taking water-dwelling
gnats and insects from the air. Swallows and swifts further
the inroads on the insect population. On shore, water snakes and an
occasional rattler take the sun and keep watch for the unwary lizard
or rodent which will make a next meal.</p>
<p>The river is a major flyway for migrating water birds, and in the
course of 12 months a large traffic of ducks, geese, and shore birds
may be seen going north or south. There is other wild traffic along
the Rio Grande, mostly evidenced by tracks left on the mudbanks and
sand bars&mdash;mink, beaver, and rarely an otter follow the stream in
their water-borne prowlings. The beavers seem to be resident on the
monument in White Rock Canyon, although the Rio Grande is too
large to allow them to build dams; the unmistakable beaver-tooth pattern
on sapling stumps is frequently seen along the riverside. On the
headwaters of the Rito de los Frijoles, about 9 miles above monument
headquarters, a permanent colony of beavers is established, pioneered
long ago by some migrant pair who left the big river to venture up the
tiny tributary.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c27">GEOLOGY.</h3>
<p>The landscape of the Bandelier area is predominantly one
of cliffs and canyons; as a visitor to the plateau you will be made
conscious of the involved structure and contour of the region in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
course of the auto trip over the approach highway. The impression
you may get on arrival is of a vast confusion of canyons separated
by equally confused mesas and ridges. The topography, however, is
not so mixed as first appearance would indicate, for there is a regularity
to the pattern of the drainage which becomes apparent from study of a
map or aerial photo. The geology, on the other hand, is extremely
complex and can be outlined only in general terms in this handbook.</p>
<p>The dominating feature of the landscape is the uplift of the Jemez
Mountains, forming the western skyline as one approaches the monument
from the east. These mountains are the remains of a great volcano
which erupted during the past million years. As seen from a
distance, there is very little to suggest a volcano in the profile of the
present mountains; only by traveling some 15 miles west of Bandelier
into the central valley of the range can the nature of the eruption be
visualized. Here is a basin of grassland ringed with forested hills,
on a scale so large that its extent is difficult to appreciate. This is the
Valle Grande&mdash;&ldquo;great valley&rdquo; of the Spanish discoverers, who could
not have known that they had found one of the largest calderas in the
world. Although the Valle Grande now has superficial characteristics
of a volcanic crater, there was no single crater here in the days of the
eruption&mdash;rather a vast dome of a mountain which poured from its
flanks such a quantity of lava and other materials that its roof finally
fell in. The dimensions of the caldera, a rough oval, are approximately
16 by 18 miles. It is estimated that at least 10 cubic miles of lava and
ashes were ejected here to produce the cavity which now exists. The
ring of hills around the oval are the remnants of the ancient volcano&rsquo;s
perimeter, which remained elevated after the central areas collapsed.</p>
<p>The volcano, then, played the chief role in fashioning the landscape
of the Pajarito Plateau. It provided an uplift of the land at the caldera,
by the same means establishing a down-slope from the center outwards,
along which the lavas of the eruption avalanched in fire and
smoke. Interspersed between the flows of heavy lavas were other
avalanches and showerings of volcanic ashes in great depth. When
cooled and welded together as they are today, they are called tuff.
This process of earth-building went on intermittently for many centuries
until the volcano had exhausted its violence and had distributed
its many cubic miles of outpourings in encircling deposits around its
flanks. With the subsidence of volcanism, the great earth-removing
force of erosion became the predominant factor in forming the
landscape.</p>
<p>The first rains and snows which fell upon this ancestral uplift found
relatively smooth slopes descending outward from the rim of the
central caldera. These rains and melted snows began to drain downhill,
finding whatever slight channels or irregularities there were in
the surface. As the centuries passed, the little water-channels became
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
gullies, then ravines, trending east and southeast through the Bandelier
quadrant, down the natural fall-line of the Pajarito slopes. In less
than a million years, the plateau has eroded into its present form and
the drainage pattern of canyons radiating from the Jemez ridge and
emptying into the Rio Grande has become well defined. Such canyons
as Frijoles, then, are the products primarily of water erosion, etched
into a one-time smooth slope of volcanic deposits.</p>
<p>During the early years of this erosion process, the caldera itself
became a lake, entrapping the runoff of waters within its circle. This
body of water eventually found an outlet to the south, through the
guarding rim of the basin, and in its outflow began the present system
of canyons of the Jemez River. A modern example of a caldera containing
a lake is to be seen in Crater Lake National Park in Oregon,
but the Valle Grande Lake had nearly six times as great an area.</p>

<p>Many of the almost sheer canyon walls of the monument provide
good cross sections of the lava and ash deposits exposed in cliffs several
hundred feet high. In simplest form, these cross sections reveal at
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
their base a flow of lava or basalt, overlain by perhaps 200 vertical feet
of tuff, and capped by another flow of lava forming the rimrock of
the mesa-top. In most places, the alternating layers of lava and tuff
were deposited several successive times, variously distributed, and complicated
by later faulting and interim periods of erosion, so that the
interpretation of the rock layers is not everywhere as simple as in the
example given above.</p>

<p>One difficulty you may encounter in understanding the makeup of
the Pajarito cliffs stems from the very different appearance of the two
opposite walls of such a canyon as Frijoles. In the north wall, facing
the sun, the cliffs stand bold and somewhat barren; in the south and
shadowed wall, there are no prominent cliffs, but rather a rough slope
of boulders overgrown with trees and brush. Because of this contrast,
it might be difficult for you to realize that the two walls are made up
of nearly identical rocks. The difference in appearance is due simply
to the difference in exposure. The north wall, hot and dry in the
sun and subject to extremes of temperature, has never had a heavy vegetative
cover and has eroded into a cliff; the south wall, relatively cool
and moist, has been able to support a growth of plants which have
held and produced soil sufficient to mask the underlying rocks.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the geology of this locality is complicated to
such a degree that the foregoing discussion should be considered as
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
only a general outline. The whole story of the Jemez volcano has
not yet been worked out in detail, for the eruptive activity was on a
scale so vast and involved such complex forces that geologists are continuing
to evolve new concepts as new facts come to light.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><br /><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<h3 class="inline">FRIJOLES CANYON.</h3>
<p>Monument headquarters are at the terminus of the
approach road, on the floor of Frijoles Canyon. This center of development
is the focal point of activity throughout the year. Listed below
are the features of interest to be found in and around the headquarters
area; reference to the map on pages <a href="#Page_20">20</a>-21 will help to locate the points
mentioned.</p>
<p>1. <i>Administration Building and Museum.</i> This building contains
a reception information desk manned by park rangers and a lobby
from which visitors leave to walk to the ruins. Reference books are
available from the monument library on request, and a stock of publications
on pertinent subjects is for sale.</p>
<p>The museum occupies a part of the headquarters building. Three
rooms of exhibits present Indian artifacts and information on the life
and origins of the prehistoric people, and on the modern Pueblo Indians
of the vicinity. A visit to the museum is advisable before making a
trip to any of the ruins, since the exhibits provide a background against
which the ruins are better understood and appreciated.</p>
<p>2. <i>Tyuonyi Ruin</i> lies about 500 yards by trail up the canyon from
headquarters. This ruin is one of the principal way-stations on the
loop trail over which the trips are routed. Other features on this same
loop are an unexcavated ruin, the Big Kiva, Sun House, Cave Kiva,
and Long House.</p>
<p>3. <i>Ceremonial Cave</i> is reached by trails either along the Rito or along
the north cliffs, approximately 1 mile above headquarters. A walk to
this cave is very popular with hikers of modest ambitions, and is particularly
rewarding to the photographer. There are a number of tall
ladders to climb to reach the cave; consequently, rubber-soled shoes
and a degree of caution are recommended.</p>
<p>4. The <i>Upper Falls</i> are downstream from headquarters about a mile
and a half. The trail follows the Rito down through some of the
handsomest forest glades on the monument, crossing the stream several
times. The falls, in a deep lava cleft, are about 80 feet high. The
<i>Lower Falls</i>, a quarter-mile farther down, are only half as high. Along
the trail between the two falls, a geologically interesting exposure of the
canyon wall is conspicuous.</p>
<h3 class="inline">OTOWI SECTION.</h3>
<p>Two large ruins, Tsankawi and Otowi, are the principal
features to visit on this detached section of the monument. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
main access road from Santa Fe to monument headquarters passes
through this section and close to the Tsankawi Ruin. Distance from
this ruin to headquarters is 16 miles.</p>
<p>5. <i>Otowi Ruin</i> lies between Pueblo and Bayo Canyons on a disused
road. Inquire of a park ranger before attempting to make the trip.</p>
<p>6. <i>Tsankawi Ruin</i> is reached by a spur road and foot trail branching
from State Route 4. At the end of the road, a stand contains
booklets for the self-guiding trail which leads up onto the mesa to the
ruins, a round trip walk of about three-quarters of a mile.</p>
<h3 class="inline">THE BACK COUNTRY.</h3>
<p>A network of some 50 miles of foot and horseback
trails reaches out from monument headquarters into the roadless southern
areas of the monument. Hikers and horseback parties frequently
make a loop trip of 2 days, visiting the Stone Lions and Yapashi Ruins,
and spending the night at Base Camp in Capulin Canyon, where a
National Park Service fire guard is on duty during the summer. The
return trip may be made past Painted Cave to the Rio Grande, then
up White Rock Canyon to Frijoles Canyon and point of beginning.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="inline">ADJACENT POINTS OF INTEREST.</h3>
<p>The <i>Valle Grande</i> is 15 miles west from
the Frijoles Canyon checking station, on State Route 4, toward Cuba,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
N. Mex. This drive across the Jemez ridge cannot be made in the
winter, for the road is never cleared of snow.</p>
<p><i>Los Alamos</i>, the atomic city, borders the monument on the north.
At the time of this writing (1955), visitors are not allowed to enter
the gates of Los Alamos without special passes.</p>
<p><i>San Ildefonso</i>, the modern Indian Pueblo nearest to the monument,
will make an interesting side trip when you either enter or leave
Bandelier. The village lies one mile north of State Route 4, just east
of the Rio Grande. This is the home of Maria Martinez, the woman
whose pottery-making skill has won nationwide awards and who was
instrumental in reestablishing the production of high-quality pottery
in the Rio Grande pueblos.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><br /><span class="small"><i>How to Reach the Monument</i></span></h2>
<p>Bandelier National Monument is 46 miles west of Santa Fe, N. Mex.,
by way of U. S. 285 to Pojoaque, then left onto State Route 4. Coming
from Taos and the north, leave U. S. 285 at Espanola, turning right
across the Rio Grande. During the summer, access is possible from
the south via Jemez Springs and through the Valle Grande on unimproved
gravel roads.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><br /><span class="small"><i>About Your Visit</i></span></h2>
<p>The monument is open every day of the year. The administration
building and museum are open daily from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. (from
8 a. m. to 9 p. m. in summer). Monument literature is available at
the reception desk.</p>
<p>Interpretive services include self-guided tours to the principal ruins
of Frijoles Canyon. Make application at the reception desk for the
booklet and map which describe the walk.</p>
<p>Two other interpretive trails are provided, one visiting the ruins
of Rainbow House immediately down canyon from headquarters;
the other, in the Otowi Section, climbing to the mesa on which
Tsankawi is situated. At the latter place, a booklet will guide you
along the trail and tell you the archeological story, point by point.</p>
<p>Each evening from mid-June until Labor Day a program is presented
at the administration building by a ranger or archeologist of the
monument staff. The subjects of these informal talks range through
many fields, from wildlife or botany to Indian ceremonials. Slides
or movies are usually shown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>A campground is maintained near headquarters along the Rito de
los Frijoles. Campsites are available in the shade of the grove which
lines the stream; and fireplaces, tables, and firewood are provided.
Housetrailers can be accommodated, and free toilet, shower, and
laundry facilities are nearby.</p>
<p>Frijoles Canyon Lodge and Restaurant, directly opposite the administration
building, provide excellent accommodations and meals under
a concession contract from the National Park Service. The lodge is
built of native stone in pueblo architecture, surrounding several landscaped
patios; it is one of the more picturesque resorts of the Santa Fe
region. The season for these accommodations is May 1 to October 15;
no meals or rooms are available in the monument during the balance
of the year. For reservations and further information write Frijoles
Canyon Lodge, Bandelier National Monument, Santa Fe, N. Mex.</p>
<p>Horseback riding is very popular over the 50-mile network of trails.
A saddle-horse concession is operated from April into October. Although
the majority of riders take horses for the day only, overnight
trips into the back country can be arranged.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><br /><span class="small"><i>Establishment and Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Adolph Bandelier, a Swiss-American historian and ethnologist, gave
the first prominence to the Pajarito Plateau ruins as a result of his explorations
and descriptions during the 1880&rsquo;s. Around the turn of the
century a bill was introduced in Congress to create here a Cliff Cities
National Park, it being apparent that some protection of the area was
necessary to reduce the vandalism of the ruins. The bill, however,
failed to pass. Presently, attention was again drawn to the area by the
archeological work in Frijoles Canyon from 1909 to 1912, directed by
the late Dr. Edgar L. Hewett. The renewed interest resulted in a
proposal by the Secretary of Agriculture, in 1915, that a national monument
be created. The Smithsonian Institution strongly supported this
idea and recommended the name Bandelier in honor of the pioneer
student of the region. The Secretary of Interior concurred, and as a
result, on February 11, 1916, Bandelier National Monument was established
by Presidential proclamation.</p>
<p>From 1916 until 1932, the monument was administered by the
Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. In
1952, the area was transferred to the National Park Service of the
United States Department of the Interior, with a small adjustment
of boundaries. The total area is now slightly over 27,000 acres. Since
1932, a National Park Service superintendent has been resident at
monument headquarters in Frijoles Canyon. The monument has a
small complement of rangers and fire guards for protection of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
ruins, the wildlife, and the forests; in the summer, several temporary
rangers are employed to aid in archeological interpretation.</p>
<p>Requests for further information should be addressed to the Superintendent,
Bandelier National Monument, Santa Fe, N. Mex.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><br /><span class="small"><i>Related Areas</i></span></h2>
<p>A number of other southwestern areas in the National Park System
have been established for the protection of prehistoric structures.
These include Mesa Verde National Park, in southwestern Colorado,
and the following national monuments: Aztec Ruins, Chaco Canyon,
and Gila Cliff Dwellings, in New Mexico; Canyon de Chelly, Casa
Grande, Montezuma Castle, Navajo, Tonto, Tuzigoot, Walnut
Canyon, and Wupatki, in Arizona.</p>
